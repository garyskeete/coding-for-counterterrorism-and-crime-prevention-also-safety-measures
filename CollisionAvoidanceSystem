CAS collision Avoidance system
In the military and civilian fields this system is conceptually deployed in snowbirds formations. In ships at sea,In vehicles of transport to avoid mines,In aircraft to avoid midair collisions of all types such as SAMs or bazookas or radar readings leading to contact with other aircraft.
In civilian the vehicles on the road are built to avoid certain circumstances built to assess angle of the sun shadows speeds distances falling objects and utilizing breaking deceleration at times if necessary acceleration avoid accidents collisions and other mishaps.
In other vehicles such as ships trains boats cars trucks motorcycles planes drones and any other vehicle of transport regarding safety measures and accident avoidance.
Should be virtually installed in part in launched rockets and for the second part virtual bomb diffusal by tracking to result in a dud smooth transition rather than crashing and exploding on contact.
