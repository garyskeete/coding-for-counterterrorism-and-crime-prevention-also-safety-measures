CONCEPTUAL PROTOTYPE

With an assist from Dream Interpretation
An assistive hand held device that can wirelessly permit the unlocking of doors the bypassing of passwords and the overall access to locked compartments mathematically and applied physics forces the overall approach would be to apply to locked car and apartment doors if the tenanted owner is locked out  the advent of using it as an investigational tool is valuable as the current process is time consuming.
So with that handheld device comes projection of holograms and particles infusing the subject at hand with computer chips DNA stem cells and scaffolds and a host of biological implementations that support life. All in an arranged precise order that denotes regeneration
The scan on the handheld device can also search for objects that a sample has been taken of such as plasma DNA or element  
The repair sequence checks first for any damage or trauma and then assists in location relief and life support administering if needed anaesthetics and supports built upon knowledge of the patient or victim 
So timing is of the essence and split second reactions and responses are applied.
