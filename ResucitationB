The distinguishing of materials and criteria that have been burnt or otherwise affected by some form of ordinance .
The look at residue from burnt criteria the look at the remnants of the cremated remains a look at the apoptosis and trauma involved in the retrieval of vital DNA involved in the fire the combustion issue reversed by animation in view of finding DNA Evidence of reanimated living genetics which in addition to stem cells reproductive biology and regenerative Medicine as well as resuscitation should hold merit.

A look at exploded ordinance from a still video pause in the suspended animation of the explosion see an you unscramble an egg? Taking the still from a picture of the event find by specialized camera any victims and realign their DNA by applying the principles of healing integrations such as self assembly polymerization and scaffolds with stem cell integration as well as afore mentioned techniques leading to Resuscitation reversal effects of the physics involved in the pressure of the explosion necessary.
THE LOOK AT VIRTUAL REALITY FROM ILLUSTRATED ANIMATION AND THE ADVENT OF AUGMENTED REALITY
The look at animation to reality in transferring the DNA of the video still through sterilization and anaestasia to reality
so the applicationof acknowledging the trauma treating it and then strengthening the patients outcome by refferring to an overlay of their body composition pre trauma for homeostasis
