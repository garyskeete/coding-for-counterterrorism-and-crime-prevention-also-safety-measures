The aspect of the animation the aspect of the egg shell should be allocated to reverse type signature at the precise point of the break but it's where the elevation is allowing for that time reversal perhaps a crack in them eggshell it exact pinpointing moment where the texture of the egg shell changes and me weakness of the eggshell is exposed the beginning's of the crack read actual allocation of the missing piece and reporting back together sequences at the Shell it's entirety the reversal process of the crack entitlement and the sewing together of the parts in reverse time signature with mathematics allow wants to show the dexterity of the fusion of the parts
So the reversal of animation of a dropped egg the distinct proposal of replacing and reformatting recovery repair and reconstruction of an otherwise unrecoverable subject matter 

The aspect of the reversal of animation involving fractal geometry from the inside out creating the template for modelling the microscopic criteria and characteristics of the subject matter. The usage of Hilbert Space to suggest a moment in time that denotes distinction in the separation and timing of looking at mechanisms which correlate to form collaborations in reconstruction repair reconfigurement reversal and resuscitation as well as regenerative recuperative reproductive processes.

The use of stem cells hematology the management of dotmatrix diagrams to represent a moment in time and cells the singling out of individual dots to invoke a series of modelling tests such as a ball or sphere along a m√∂bius transformation

Taking the stem cells and applied mathematics and physics to acquire a state of juxtaposition in particle physics for partial reality partial assimilation partial self-assembly of poly more isolation the actual attending of surgical glue for self-assembly and the application of dissolving
The attainment of the state of longevity for genetics by applying the positioning of self-assembly to stuff sells the application of an exploded view of fragmented stem cell to create the creek scenario for a stem cell application to apply to genetics DNA molecular biology application of cell biology in part of it all the partial recognition of parts of subcells to initialize real-time application for polymerization self-assembly completion of regenerative parts And reanimation
The realization of the importance of this in brain chemistry and brain sciences for the regeneration of the brain for the juxtaposition of visual centres in the brain for positioning of thought cognition and rewiring of the brain for the removal of Psychopathic disorder of Alzheimer's of Glioblastoma of schizophrenia of mental disorders and mental diseases mental illnesses and mental ailments be expectation being the healing element as eventual outcome

Application of particle physics and reverse time hologram for the unscrambling of an egg for the placement of a yolk back in the shell the application of a hologram resulting in reverse animation

Here's a conceptual adaptation of supramolecular brain surgery and enlargement of the skull
The aspect of the animation the aspect of the egg shell should be allocated to reverse type signature at the precise point of the break but it's where the elevation is allowing for that time reversal perhaps a crack in them eggshell it exact pinpointing moment where the texture of the egg shell changes and the weakness of the eggshell is exposed the beginning's of the crack read actual allocation of the missing piece and reporting back together sequences at the Shell it's entirety the reversal process of the crack entitlement and the sewing together of the parts in reverse time signature with mathematics allow wants to show the dexterity of the fusion of the parts

Can you unscramble an egg 
or put an eggshell back together with the yolk intact inside the application of going from a scrambled egg to egg yolk inside a complete eggshell going backwards through time can be achieved by animation the application being movie animated sequence of events going backwards through time and at the yolk returning to the shell of the intact egg
So with that application we have applications of pixels of light applying themselves in a synchronize matter to achieve the result of the reverse time application of the yolk being intact inside the egg and with that we have the mathematical calculations of the computer to show the final disposition of particles of parts of the eggshell parts of the yolk that are undergoing change and frequency of particle assimilation read adjustment of replacement mathematically would be the assessment needed to show where it polymerization and where in acquisition of parts of the eggshell mathematically by looking for  example at a puzzle that is put together then set apart then put together again and looking at the aspect of helium and self-assembly by perhaps nano bots  nanomedicine scaffolds that self dissect  and dissolve after bonding parts or by polymerization blown apart view in slow motion animation
