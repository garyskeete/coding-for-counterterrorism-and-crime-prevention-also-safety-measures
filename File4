The adaptation of a pool table extended in this case holographically with the added ideation that it could be compounded to formulate a polygon or multi sided shape we have the adaptation of teleportation along the  newly acquired holographic edges which transport the billiard balls accordingly within the framework of the holographic and original table without overlaps.
 So if the billiard table is for the sake of argument triangular the compounding shape would be a octagon hexagon or polygon due to placement and multiplication of the triangle. The overall aspect of the holographic allowing the computer itself to plot strategies for billiard ball interaction as well as strategy for game play the angles the distance and the force needed to complete the interaction are needed implementations in these instances.
In revealing that people have usually conversations around billiard tables it would not be uncommon for military rank to converse in a manner planning battle strategies discussing past experiences and working out plans for avoiding surprise attacks such as skirmishes and bombings
Again we see the billiards table put into view with the planned coordination of winning strategy the computer formulates a plan for determination of success the ball can be jumped by adhering pressure at a certain angle and allow it to land on another with force enough to complete an action. Corners are pockets so the trajectory stops
So if this can be changed to instead of a billiard table represent a holographic clock See research and the pockets representing captured moments in time or reconstructions moments where movement of the timepiece stands still theoretically we can construct a time machine based on angular movement faster than the speed of light.
