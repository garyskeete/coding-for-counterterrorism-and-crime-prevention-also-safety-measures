}}The Super Soldier Program
Would it be possible for Watson in non invasive brain surgery by ultrasound to come up with a deep learning algorithm to be transfixed and placed in human memory with the speed and accuracy of computer super Intelligence?
The program can take the speed of the Flash and produce a search algorithm
The prediction power of Vision and introduce thought projection through ESP
The virtual web power of Spider-Man and suffocate a bomb or fire 
Another adaptation to Spider-Man's webbing would be a cocoon for medically induced coma
The strength of a combination of heroes Superman and the Hulk
The intelligence and fighting spirit of Captain America
The technique and know how of Martial Arts and Gymnastics of Daredevil.

The techniques of simulations and augmented reality along with holographic representations in particle self assembly for complexity touch and realism Building not only supportive environments with signal officer designation communications and support but complex living arrangements perhaps in the desert underground or in the  Artic  or in the sky or under the ocean designation of details of work related designs and supplemental reading materials mail and all the comforts of home for long details.
The overall concept incorporating a structure that can be moved by disassembling and rebuilding
So communications and signalling as well as deployment education and work in military designations and leading to research and development the description of some new defence related weapons systems
Such as the diffuser of weapons systems by electronic impulse magnetic interlock and frequency modulation targeted sonics and sonar and impulse regulation EIMIFMTSSIR
The design of such a system built as a safety mechanism or shut off switch for an onslaught of warheads weaponry or deployment.

In view of launched projectiles against allied countries we have designated a new vehicle the Hulk buster missile it involves the adherence to booster rockets such as on the space shuttle but the carried compartment utilizes its space to eject multiple targeting scram jet warheads.To be deployed at multiple targets or consistently blow to smithereens one targeted area.

The complexity in the operative status can be described as the computer in life saving mode is connected to the suspended animation of the coma induced patient who is on life support and is under control of equipment machines and techniques that command the brain heart and lungs senses reflexes and overall support the patient to the affect of provisioning a adult biobag for Resuscitation repair and rejuvenation.
After support is functioning and all priorities are met anatomically under support the gradual reanimation takes place ridding the body of dead cells through dispelling of apoptosis and extension of the faint glimmer of life through stem cells.
When the computer commands brain memory reflexes and cognition the reanimation of memory cells takes place then in queries the patient is looked at for a subliminal response gathering strength and brain activity until support is gradually weaned and the patient is awakened from their medically induced coma.
The scientific question here is can a medically induced coma be influential in the resuscitation process of the deceased?
So with the reorganization of processes that were once totally supportive reduced to monitoring sensors gradually we have simplified in this brief the process of resuscitation.

Out of the box

Collaboration of intrinsic value that causes differential between receive notion of real activity due to product is the second decision to induce psychosis virtual consistencies to refer to holographic control sequences placed internally by frequency sonar laser sonics mentally to have control over reactions thoughts cognition and memory recall the overall aspect of collaboration in the area of the distinct reality
The possibilities of a method of augmented reality to be complemented by the notion of holographic implementation of the augmented reality the interface between the two being the implementation of freestanding projected holograms
Collaboration of  the time signature to the allocation of all of graphic application in to time zones into the mechanism of phobic so reversing the application of trauma that is induced after an incident or experience and removing psychological triggers.
The freedom of individualized conceptual thinking for a group exercise that involves creative constructive thinking without borders.
