An instance where reverse time animation could be applied to produces viable outcome over various platforms

The application of a vehicular accident
The vehicle being dented damaged and scattered wreckage across an expanse
No video cameras recording the incident
Cameras used however to determine animated placement of vehicle on road to determine pre collision placement and status
The scattered remnants of the wreckage are recorded in camera visuals along with computer animation allow for the reversal effect of strewn wreckage to revert back to placement on the vehicle with visual references.
This would include physics forces acceleration distance time and mass to determine the calculation of mathematics which creates the trajectory and the angles to revert back to original state in the animated vehicle.
So twisted wreckage and damage is counteracted by forces of calculated computer visual display and return to the vehicle in real time and slow motion with an exploded view of the original car parts and an exploded view of the damage for comparisons.
