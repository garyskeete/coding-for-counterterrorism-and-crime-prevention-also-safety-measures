This is to correspond to mapping over a certain area a divulging within that mapping certain criteria in a search the operon for the search criteria can vary from DNA to vehicle make to ballistics to clothing to characteristics features ambulation eye colour

In a mathematical search algorithm identifying key characteristics an individual or group of individuals can be sorted through their individual characteristics  placed in categorical reference and identified by coding.
