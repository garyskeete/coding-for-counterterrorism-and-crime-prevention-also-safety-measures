Art is Functional
Here's a try at useful design
 Place water piping in buildings around the outside of windows with water with enough force to break the window and put out the fire.
So as not to waste water makes the pipes directional inwardly in designing the flow of water through the pipes throughout the dwellings on different floors.
Here's where the Art of the design comes in.
Some people  prefer Gargoyles
So design a plastering over of the pipes that is compliant with the design of the building and is unique
Remembering it runs along the outside of the building.
Non burning plastic coverage or fitted alloys over pipes accepted.

The building in my thoughts was outfitted with such apparatus but inside contained advanced bio bags for Resuscitation as the linkup with Heaven on the computer at IBM was functional the water of life as administered throughout the building cascading down showing the full majesty of the flow of mighty waters in artful design.
Soon all was well.
