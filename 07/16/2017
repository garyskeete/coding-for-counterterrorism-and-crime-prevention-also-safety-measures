The Mathematical Discussion

1. The aspect of Geometry
2. The aspect of Hilbert Space
3. Grover's Algorithm
4. Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division
5. 3D Cartesian Mapping

With reference to geometrical shapes which coincide readily to formulate the shapes of objects and using such features as Hilbert Space to identify a moment in time a characteristic a place or an item a category can be assigned in list format from a list.
The aspect of Grover's Algorithm being utilized as a search and identify mechanism pinpointing whereabouts locale or specific details of characteristic biomarkers DNA RNA or finding objects within a virtual reality augmented reality infused mapping which can be 3 Dimensional.
The mathematical configurations which allow for detection eliminating the irrelevant and adhering to the information in the operon.

P.S. For an easier correlation teach the computer to play hide and seek then put your variable in the operon.By applying the identity of the Garmin mapping to location mapping on google earth maps a search mechanism for DNA through Grover's Algorithm the queen identifying the characteristics needed can be formulated in a virtual reality augmented reality headset.
