Changing scenario in the holographic bubble expanse of time zones interpretation of environments ; changing positions of environments due to the faster than light inter millisecond impulses which intercept the time zones condensed format.The holographic bubble is an interchangeable time machine of scenarios moving faster than the speed of light encountering therefore daylight in a flash investigated by Hilbert Space Mathematics as it can be suspended in time
So the changing scenarios from one time zone to another includes environments and the individual environmental changes which through teleportation are theoretically interchangeable
The environments being placed holographically faster than the speed of light and then interchanged at that speed by the time light is inferred it is a speck of light measured upon a linear continuum  a flash of light to be mathematically investigated as it represents the entirety of daylight movements reflexes thought word and deed
