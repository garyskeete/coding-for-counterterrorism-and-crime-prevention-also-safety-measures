Changing scenario in the holographic bubble expanse of time zones interpretation of environments ; changing positions of environments due to the faster than light inter millisecond impulses which intercept the time zones condensed format.The holographic bubble is an interchangeable time machine of scenarios moving faster than the speed of light encountering therefore daylight in a flash investigated by Hilbert Space Mathematics as it can be suspended in time
So the changing scenarios from one time zone to another includes environments and the individual environmental changes which through teleportation are theoretically interchangeable
