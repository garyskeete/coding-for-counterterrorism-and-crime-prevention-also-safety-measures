The creation of a resuscitation technique derived from the specialized photography allowing for DNA magnification photonic integration pixel realization and reproductive biology techniques in regenerative biology scaffold building self-assembly polymerization techniques reanimation of images and techniques associated with time travel placing a photon in current time transferring it over date lines to be reproduced at a moment in time in hours forward or reverse according to placement sameness of luminosity and consistency and overall affect.
Or placing a Qubit in a photonics hologram that encompasses a given area with the adaptation of adding a material element solid liquid or gas and transferring through methods of speeded up search engine interface to a speed less than zero seconds to collaborate with Pi and wormhole integration represented by hyperbolas to produce an effect on the movement of the second hand on a clock within a holographic implementation of a virtual reality construct augmented reality infused to instil the notion of suspended animation supportive to life forms with speeded up integration of DNA and RNA representation of coordination in realtime translation because of the effect of the speeded up holographic time interface.
So the implementation of mathematical formulas to predict Eternity and what effects it represents on the physical body as well as mentality the proper correlation to mathematical formulae and equations in problem solving in a quantum reality of teleportation.
With that the effect of having a reverse time integration for non invasive investigation techniques.
