Red blood cells are formed in the red bone marrow of bones. Stem cells in the red bone marrow called hemocytoblasts give rise to all of the formed elements in blood. If a hemocytoblast commits to becoming a cell called a proerythroblast, it will develop into a new red blood cell.
The formation of a red blood cell from hemocytoblast takes about 2 days. The body makes about two million red blood cells every second.
Calcium for bones formed by a temporary mutation in the CASR gene.

* Complete blood count (CBC), which determines the number, size, volume, and hemoglobin content of red blood cells
* Blood iron level and your serum ferritinlevel, the best indicators of your body's total iron stores
* Levels of vitamin B12 and folate, vitamins necessary for red blood cell production
* Special blood tests to detect rare causes of anemia, such as an immune attack on your red blood cells, red blood cell fragility, and defects of enzymes, hemoglobin, and clotting
* Reticulocyte count, bilirubin, and other blood and urine tests to determine how quickly your blood cells are being made or if you have a hemolytic anemia, where your red blood cells have a shortened life span

<h1>Time Travel</h1>
<p>The time travel and teleportation experiment to be conducted in super molecular molecular and sub atomic particles be quarks the protons the photons the electrons all kept in alignment all precise and calibrated after teleportation in time travel to make sure there's no difference no damaging conclusions no complications no compromise the exact homeostasis and developmental stage of elemental design DNA RNA and molecular substances super molecular particles and the overall aspect but everything is as it were before except for improvements in Qubit related combinations</p>

So the functioning in Git to realign and restructure as well as read and apply commands in coding the calculus to define better avenues for mathematical modelling according to the development of specific antibodies with respect to genetic cellular and molecular makeup the reading of the body makeup considerations to lifestyle of diet exercise cognition sleep and the aspect of globally measuring brain activity for comparative analysis and collaboration the application of IBM computation to advance and enhance readout capabilities and conclusions according to individual anatomy and the aspect of a return to daily living through adjustments leading to Homeostasis. The aspect of Growth in a Healthy individual longevity anti aging and immortality medicine with respect to quality of life.

The laneways to which individual traffic of moveable vehicles is joined. The assignment being the usage of those protocols to apply in virtual reality constructing an actual highway leading to the physical construction and computerized library infrastructure and synthetic life form avatar and AI guide to be transformed into a workable inserted dimension life size to be allocated by string theory and Hilbert Space placement in a place designated for open space with the particle theory of holographic light to matter thereby bringing the concept to reality with respect to different dimensions.
So it would be the aspect of travelling down one highway and having as many exits to different dimensions as desired.
In effect also would be the additional concept of doorways be assigned the time travel coordinates and functions being able to travelling any direction to different dimensions and moments in time.
