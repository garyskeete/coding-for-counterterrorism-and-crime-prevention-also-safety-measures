The use of a specialized camera to record not only image but chemical and biological structures and the subsequent design of formatting utilization of gestalt DNA and RNA Epigenetic de methylation of any coexistence of cancer or disease cells repair of any trauma existence of stem cells by collaboration to heal through structures such as scaffolds regenerative medicine and biology self assembly and polymerization
The subsequent placement on a 3D Cartesian mapping the mathematical integration and modelling the aspect of placing the image in a virtual reality environment the aspect of synthetic biology synthetic life forms computational neuroscience and a query that familiarized brain cells with previously known subject matter the aspect of experience gained from augmented reality landscapes and circumstances as models for illustration for animation to reality

Simultaneously 

The restorative completion of a multifaceted approach involving different types of plants and animals involved in labs and the subsequent transfer of those healing and healthy motifs and methods to human research standards.
