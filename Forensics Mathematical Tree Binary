For Example
1.The Aim would be to trace the origins of substances fond in the pollen of certain types of plants over given areas of concern
2.The Objective would be to find a method of research that coincides with the details involved and construct viable alternatives
3.The Research would involve identification of individual components items Flora and fauna people places things
4.The Tree would involve mathematical processes equivalents of composition chlorophyll speed of wind direction  amount of Bees caterpillars butterflies insects in general present daily pollution count and forest infiltration campsites drilling excavation garbage collection equivalents in toxicity amount of sunlight perforating through the trees forest mist dew fog bogs composition all known components
5.Tracing Origin would be the evolution backwards and forwards of the entire process of Discovery and Evidence with details definitions and visual aides such as drawings photos or video
6.Identification of Process
Would be the method in which calculations were carried out and their relationship to the mathematical tree for example a Geiger counter  a temperature gauge a measurement of a wind vane a measurement of the consistency of pollen
7.Definitions would be the intro to details describing the processes more in depth and reverting to scientific methods and calculations for validity
8.Sequence of events would be putting together all information in proper order and in order of importance of threat of biological or chemical hazard of relevance in numerical point format
9.Conclusion results defined concluding remarks  % of accuracy and likelihood
10.References footnotes and bibliography glossary
