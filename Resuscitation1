An attempt at restoring life through modern day techniques of lifesaving with adaptations

Machines  and techniques for Resuscitation
Inducing a coma like state into the deceased-simulation of life synthetic host based on patients DNA
Bath in detox like gel for reduction of decomposition
Stem cell integration to repair and reset injection into spinal column -Resuscitation 
Gestalt locator and compiler- particle inducement spectral analysis
 Hyper ventilator for breathing bariatric chamber
HydooxyGenetics specialized infused water for revival based on amniotic fluid Artificial womb
Particle inducement simulator with illustrated animation-Biological Film Inplementation
Reanimation of cells molecular consistency DNA functioning- Regenerative Biology
Removal of poisons pathogens viral entities- detox
Life support system with Anaesthetics Suspended Animation
Heart beat and circulatory support  pacemaker medical machine
Brain function cognition memory and recall computational neuroscience
Organ support and maintenance kidney liver pancreas functioning support for small intestine colon dialysis monitors flushing
Nutrition and digestion support stomach and body extremities reached feeding tube
Overall observance through  combination ultrasound/ MRI/Display Monitor
Restoration through application of removal from coma like state
Restoration of youth through cosmetic surgery plastic surgery liposuction and restorative balms creams lotions


Combination of these machines with interfaces and patches to permit the smooth integration from long since deceased to living with quality of life

These aspects should be considered before attempting resuscitation of long term deceased  as the supportive measures should last until the patient is fully restored and self supportive.
